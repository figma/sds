# Simple Design System (alpha)

Using Figma's [Code Connect](https://github.com/figma/code-connect).

Simple Design System (SDS) is a base design system that shows how Figma’s Variables, Styles, Components, and Code Connect can be used alongside a React codebase to form a complete picture of a responsive web design system.

SDS is not just another design system in Figma. There are still many gaps between design and development, and SDS provides some best practices for how to bridge them. SDS tries to remain honest about its implications in code, while also offering customizability in design beyond the simple theming layer that is typical of many code-first component libraries.

Whether you’re looking to use SDS to start a new project, or are looking for examples of some common design systems best practices, you'll find tools inside this codebase and design file to steer you in the right direction.

## Resources

- [Figma Community File](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1380235722331273046/simple-design-system)

## Setup

- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run app:dev` will run server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) which renders contents of [App.tsx](src/App.tsx)

### Figma Auth

- [Create a Figma API token](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#authentication)
  - Add Code Connect scope
  - Add File Read, Dev Resources Write, and Variables scopes if you want to use the integrations in [scripts](./scripts/)
  - [More on scopes](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#authentication-scopes)
- Duplicate [.env-rename](./.env-rename)
- Rename it to `.env`, it will be ignored from git.
  - Set `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=` as your token in `.env`
  - Set `FIGMA_FILE_KEY=` as your file's key (grab it from the file URL) in `.env`

### Code Connect

SDS is fully backed by Figma's Code Connect. This includes examples for how to connect [components](./src/figma/components/).

This repo utilizes `documentUrlSubstitutions` in [figma.config.json](./figma.config.json). This allows us to keep our docs Figma file-agnostic and colocates all the Figma file-specific information for easy url swapping. The document URL substitutions are also named in a way that helps you find the associated component without clicking a link. A key `<FIGMA_INPUTS_CHECKBOX_GROUP>` is broken down as `<FIGMA_[PAGE_NAME]_[COMPONENT_NAME]>`.

```json
{
  "documentUrlSubstitutions": {
    "<FIGMA_INPUTS_CHECKBOX_GROUP>": "https://figma.com/design/whatever?node-id=123-456"
  }
}
```

Allows us to have more expressive URLs in our Code Connect docs:

```js
figma.connect(CheckboxGroup, "<FIGMA_INPUTS_CHECKBOX_GROUP>");
```

### Connecting this repo to a duplicated Figma file

With the above in mind, a fresh clone of the Simple Design System Figma file should maintain all the node-ids. The steps should be as follows:

- Duplicate the [Figma Community File](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1380235722331273046/simple-design-system)
- Clone this repo
- Update urls in [figma.config.json](./figma.config.json) to point to your Figma file
  - Note: the file keys (eg. `J0KLPKXiONDRssXD1AX9Oi`) should be the only change in the urls unless you're creating new components, detaching and recreating.
- Create and set your [Figma Auth Token](#figma-auth)
- At that point, `npx figma connect publish` should work and your new file should have Code Connect.

## Structure

All components and styles are in [src/ui](./src/ui). Within that directory, code is broken down into a few categories.

### [src/ui/hooks](./src/ui/hooks/)

Custom React hook definitions

### [src/ui/icons](./src/ui/icons/)

All icon components. Automatically generated by [scripts/icons](./scripts/icons)

### [src/ui/images](./src/ui/images/)

Placeholder images.

### [src/ui/components](./src/ui/components/)

The main component library. SDS components can't be reduced further into sub components.

### [src/ui/providers](./src/ui/providers/)

Custom React provider definitions

### [src/ui/utils](./src/ui/utils/)

Custom utilities and utility components

## Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

### Component API Guidelines

- **Always check existing component props**: Read the TypeScript definitions in component files
- **Use semantic prop names**: `isSelected` not `active`, `variant` not `type`
- **Leverage composition**: Combine components rather than creating custom components
- **Follow naming conventions**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for props

### Essential Rules

- **Never hardcode colors, spacing, or typography values** - Always use CSS variables
- **Always import components from their specific paths** - Use the alias imports
- **Check component props before using** - Read the TypeScript definitions
- **Reference existing stories in [src/stories](../src/stories/) for usage examples**

### Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Hardcoding design values

```tsx
<div style={{ color: "#111111", padding: "16px" }}> // WRONG
```

**Fix**: Use CSS variables via class names: `<div className="example">` and `.example { color: var(--sds-color-text-default-default); padding: var(--sds-size-space-400); }`

### �� Pitfall 2: Creating custom layout CSS

```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4"> // WRONG
```

**Fix**: Use layout components: `<Flex direction="row" gap="400" type="third">`

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Not reading component APIs

```tsx
<Button active={true}> // WRONG - prop doesn't exist
```

**Fix**: Read the TypeScript file: `<Button isSelected>` or `<Button variant="primary">`

## Component Categories

### components (`src/ui/components/`)

Single-purpose, reusable components (alphabetically ordered):

- **Accordion** - Expandable content sections with `Accordion` and `AccordionItem`
- **Avatar** - User profile images and placeholders
- **Button** - Primary, neutral, subtle variants with size options
- **Checkbox** - Boolean selection controls with validation states
- **Dialog** - Modal dialogs and overlays with backdrop
- **Fieldset** - Form fieldset grouping with legend
- **Icon** - Consistent icon rendering (check [src/ui/icons](../src/ui/icons/) for available icons)
- **IconButton** - Icon-only buttons with accessible labels
- **Image** - Responsive images with loading states
- **Input** - Form input fields with validation states and labels
- **Link** - Navigation and external links with proper styling
- **ListBox** - Selection lists with keyboard navigation
- **Logo** - Brand logos and identity elements
- **Menu** - Dropdown menus and context menus
- **Navigation** - Navigation pills and buttons with selection states
- **Notification** - Toast notifications and alerts
- **Pagination** - Page navigation controls with page numbers
- **Radio** - Single selection from multiple options
- **Search** - Search input fields with suggestions
- **Select** - Dropdown selection components with search
- **Slider** - Range input controls with min/max values
- **Switch** - Toggle controls for boolean settings
- **Tab** - Tab navigation with panels
- **Table** - Data tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- **Tag** - Labels, badges, and category indicators
- **Text** - Typography components with semantic variants
- **Textarea** - Multi-line text input with resize options
- **Tooltip** - Contextual help and information overlays

### Hooks (`src/ui/hooks/`)

UI-specific custom React hooks:

- **useMediaQuery** - Responsive breakpoint detection

## Figma Integration

SDS uses Figma Code Connect for seamless design-to-code integration. Here's how it works:

- **Design Tokens**: Figma styles are synced as CSS custom properties (e.g., `--sds-color-primary`)
- **Components**: Figma components are mapped to SDS components with equivalent props and variants
- **Assets**: Figma images and icons are exported as React components or assets

### Figma File Setup

To enable Code Connect:

1. Use the **"SDS - Design Tokens"** and **"SDS - Components"** styles in Figma
2. Organize components in Figma using the same structure as SDS (components, compositions, etc.)
3. Publish changes in Figma, then run `npm run script:tokens` and `npm run script:icons` to sync

### Known Limitations

- Not all Figma features have 1:1 parity with SDS components (e.g., complex interactions)
- Some manual adjustment may be needed after syncing, especially for layout and spacing
- Ensure Figma components are named and organized according to SDS conventions for best results
